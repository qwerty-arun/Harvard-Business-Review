# Harvard-Business-Review (IMPORTANT POINTS)
## In recent years, at least 70% of mergers and aquisitions succeed. There are four reasons why:- 
> 1) Companies are taking a broader approach to M&A. They are pursuing deals to develop toeholds in emerging industries or geographies, to make their supply chains more efficient.
> 2) In the past, only whether financials made sense was the focus. Now, the companies make cultural assessments to determine how well the people working in the target company will adapt to the norms and values of the acquirer. "The best acquirers quickly make themselves authorities on the businesses they are pursuing".
> 3) Fewer megadeals have been done between companies and instead more frequent and more-modest transactions have been pursued. More deals means that you have dedicated M&A people who acquire more and more experience over time.
> 4) An organization gains experience by making acquisitions more frequently, they learn what integration tasks they need to prioritize, what areas are likely to be troublesome, and how to make key decisions more efficiently.
